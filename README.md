This repository contains code and data for the paper:  
**"Riverbank Change Detection in the Jamuna River Floodplain, Bangladesh: A Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Approach"**  

## Overview  
This study uses **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, remote sensing techniques, and machine learning** to analyze riverbank changes in the **Jamuna River Basin, Bangladesh**. It aims to detect erosion patterns and predict future riverbank shifts to support sustainable land management.  

## Methodology  
- **Data Acquisition:** Sentinel-2 imagery (2015â€“2023) from Google Earth Engine (GEE).  
- **Preprocessing:** Cloud masking, spectral index calculations (NDVI, EVI, mNDWI).  
- **Feature Extraction:** Identifying land, water, and vegetation zones.  
- **Machine Learning:** Models like **XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost** for riverbank change prediction.  
- **Risk Classification:** KMeans clustering to categorize erosion risk zones.  

## Results  
- Accurate riverbank change detection with **high-performance ML models**.  
- Identification of **high-risk erosion zones** for proactive intervention.
